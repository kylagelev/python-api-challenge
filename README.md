# APIs-challenge
Collected and sparsed through data from weather API. Created dataframe that includes city, country, latitude, longitude, date, and a series of weather conditions such as: Max_Temp, Humidity, Cloudiness, Wind_Speed. Evaluated weather conditions with latitude using matplotlib and pandas to create scatterplots (of both Southern and Northern Hemisphere latitudes, and combined hemisphere latitude) with corresponding analysis. 
Used data to filter out ideal weather conditions to vacation to, and found hotels in a 5000 meter radius of each city. Displayed onto gmap with heatlayer and markers.
