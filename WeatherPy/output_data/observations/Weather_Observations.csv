Observations
"Based upon the above graphs, it appears that greatest relationship found is between latitude and maximum temperature. However, other graphs still leave ambiguity as to how latitude (distance from equator) affects humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. Therefore, perhap a follow-up graph could be created to assess the correlation between minimum temperature or average temperature and latitude."
"It seems that looking at the overall latitude vs wind speed scatterplot, it can be seen that the majority of cities have low wind speeds except for a certain few that were typically farther from the equator."
"Despite most of the greatest humidity being found around the equator (closer to 0 latitude), there was very low humidity slightly north of the equator. Based on this, it can further assessed what may cause the drop in humidity in these areas."
