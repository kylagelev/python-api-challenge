Scatter_Observations
"It appears that in the Northern Hemisphere there is a negative correlation between Latitude and Max_Temp, implying that more northern regions experience colder temperatures. Vice verse we see that the Southern Hemisphere describes a positive weak correlation between latitude and max temp. However, it does appear that cities nearer the hemisphere experience higher temperatures than those farther away."
"Despite the weak positive correlation seen in both the Southern and Northern Hemisphere between latitude and humidity, it appears that in the Southern Hemisphere the humidity increases as latitude gets closer to zero/closer to the equator. This is odd as the Northern Hemisphere displays that humidity actually increases farther from the equator."
"Correlation between latitude and cloudiness in either hemisphere is positive, but also quite weak. However, it appears to be slightly more cloudy the farther away from the equator the city is."
"From these two scatterplots, it can be seen that there is little to no correlation between wind speed and latitude. Therefore, wind speed cannot be ultimately determined by the closer a city is to the equator. However, despite this evaluation, there is still a slight positive correlation in the Northern Hemisphere, while a slight negative correlation in the Southern Hemisphere, indicating that the farther away from the equator a city is, the wind speed may be slightly greater."
